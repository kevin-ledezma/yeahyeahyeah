Perfect Breakfest Tacos
Ingredients: Filling: Two eggs, chorizo (or .5 can of cooked beans and 1 avocado, maseca for tortillas.
Salsa: 6 tomatillos, 1 medium sized yellow onion, two serrano peppers, and a diente of garlic
Make the Filling: 
Two eggs, a fistful of chorizo (or refried beans and avocado!), cheese if desired
Salsa- cut all veggies and broil for 15-25 minutes, blending at the end of time- do not add much water.

Tortillas: Buy maseca (I like to use masienda)- in a bowl, mix 1.5-2 cups with hot water, let stand for ten minutes in bowl under a towel. During these ten minutes,
heat a cast iron pan to ripping high heat. After the ten minutes, with clean hands, pinch off a ping-pong sized dough, shaping with your hands in a rolling motion. 
Using a tortilla press between two sheets of wax paper, press downward. Flip the pressed tortilla dough over and press again slightly. Lastly, pull the dough from the
wax paper and cook the tortillas. Store tortillas in a basket under a towel to steam.

Make the Filling: 
Two eggs, a fistful of chorizo (or refried pinto beans and avocado!). In a heated pan, add chorizo and cook out, addings cracked eggs at last few minutes. 
Alternatively, cook eggs first, add oil to a pan and fry pinto beans until the two or three of the beans come apart, and cut avocados open
